## Services

Project files that handle the connection to databases or API calls. This folder is also for "Controllers" as they work in the same way and just have a different name (depends on your way of working).

Be sure to import "Foundation".

Use  upper CamelCase to name files. Name them as services in the folder as well. In case you make multiple services for your contribution, put them in a subfolder named according to the use of the services. Use upper CamelCase for the naming of the folder as well.
