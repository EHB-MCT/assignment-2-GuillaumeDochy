## Views

Use Views to display a specific screen using SwiftUI. Views can also be used to make reusable UI (ex: NavBar). Reusable Views are to be put in the Shared subfolder.

Be sure to import and use "SwiftUI".

Use upper CamelCase to name Views according to their use or what they render. In case multiple Views are made for a single use case/ contribution, please put them in a subfolder named accordingly to the use case. Also, use upper CamelCase to name the subfolder.
